# Miniflux Custom CSS Themes
Here is the collection of themes that I created for Miniflux. Just Select the correct theme (dark / light) and paste the content of CSS file to Custom CSS area in settings.

## OneDark Theme (Dark Theme)

This one is very old. Originally published as a gist. I thought it would be better to collect them all in a same place.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/OneDarkListView.png" width="412px" alt="OneDark List View" /> 
  <img src="/assets/OneDarkArticleView.png" width="412px" alt="OneDark Article View" />
</div>

## Catppuccin Theme (Dark Theme)

I used Mocha version for theme.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/CatppuccinListView.png" width="412px" alt="Catppuccin List View" /> 
  <img src="/assets/CatppuccinArticleView.png" width="412px" alt="Catppuccin Article View" />
</div>
